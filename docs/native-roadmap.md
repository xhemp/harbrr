# Native-driver roadmap

Forward-looking build plan for the trackers harbrr can only serve with a **native driver** —
the ones shipped as bespoke C# in *both* Jackett and Prowlarr, so there is no Cardigann YAML
to vendor. This sequences the demand-gated backlog by leverage; the current-state auth-shape
analysis it builds on is [`coverage.md` §4](coverage.md). Pattern: [`native-indexer-pattern.md`](native-indexer-pattern.md).

## The leverage rule

A native driver covers **one API *shape*, not one site.** Trackers running the same software
behind different hostnames share a single driver (AvistaZ is one driver serving four sites:
AvistaZ/CinemaZ/PrivateHD/ExoticaZ). So the backlog splits into **families** (one build, many
trackers) and **one-offs** (one build, one tracker). All reuse the shared native framework —
the `native.Driver` interface + registry plumbing, paced client, encrypted secrets, normalized
release, category mapper, and the authenticated `/dl` path — so each new driver is only three
pieces: a settings struct, a request generator, and a response parser. None is from scratch.

**Effort calibration** (the four shipped drivers): each is ~1.5–2.1k source LOC + ~0.8–1.1k
test LOC, **offline-gated** (stub API server + synthetic goldens derived from Prowlarr's
documented contract, never a live capture), then **live-validated** against a Prowlarr
differential + a real grab. A family base lands at the top of that range but amortizes over
every site it covers.

## Build leverage

| Build | API shape | Reuses | One build covers | ⭐ payoff | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Gazelle base** | cookie → `ajax.php` → passkey DL | 🆕 new shape | RED, OPS, DICMusic, Libble, GreatPosterWall, BrokenStones… | ⭐⭐ RED + OPS | High base, amortized over many sites |
| **Passkey/JSON** | passkey + JSON API | ✅ FileList | HDBits, BeyondHD (+ MTeam, NorBits, SceneHD) | ⭐⭐ HDBits + BeyondHD | Low–med; cheaper after the first |
| **Cookie-scrape base** | session cookie + HTML scrape | ✅ IPTorrents | TorrentDay, SpeedCD (+ AlphaRatio, FunFile, BitHDTV…) | ⭐⭐ TorrentDay + SpeedCD | Med base; each extra ≈ selectors |
| **PassThePopcorn** | bespoke movie API | framework only | PTP only | ⭐ | Med (discrete) |
| **BroadcastTheNet** ✅ done (#62) | own JSON-RPC `getTorrents` | framework only | BTN only | ⭐ | shipped 2026-06-24 |
| **GazelleGames** | bespoke games API | framework only | GG only | ⭐ | Med (discrete) |
| **AnimeBytes** | own API | framework only | AB only | ⭐ | Med (discrete) |

The top three are families/pattern-reuses (high coverage per build); the bottom four are
discrete one-offs (one tracker each, framework reused but no shared request/parse logic).

> **Built so far:** ⭐ BroadcastTheNet (#62, live-confirmed) · and in **#63** ⭐ Redacted, ⭐ Orpheus,
> ⭐ PassThePopcorn, ⭐ GazelleGames, ⭐ AnimeBytes, ⭐ HDBits, ⭐ BeyondHD, ⭐ TorrentDay — all
> **offline-gated, LIVE-UNTESTED** (no operator creds; see `coverage.md` §4 + `internal/smoke/README.md`).

## Recommended sequence (leverage × popularity)

1. ~~**Gazelle base driver** (RED + OPS)~~ — ✅ built #63. (The username/password Gazelle sites —
   DICMusic/GPW/BrokenStones — remain; they need a login-flow addition to the driver.)
2. ~~**HDBits + BeyondHD**~~ — ✅ built #63 (passkey/JSON shape).
3. **Cookie-scrape base** — ~~TorrentDay~~ ✅ built #63; **SpeedCD + AlphaRatio/FunFile/BitHDTV/… remain**
   (reuse the IPTorrents/TorrentDay shape; SpeedCD is HTML-scrape, deferred until page samples or creds).
4. **Bespoke one-offs** — ~~BroadcastTheNet (#62)~~, ~~PassThePopcorn~~, ~~GazelleGames~~, ~~AnimeBytes~~
   all ✅ built; **Nebulance** remains.

**Remaining backlog (demand-gated):** SpeedCD + the cookie-scrape tail, MTeam/NorBits/SceneHD (passkey),
the username/password Gazelle sites, and Nebulance — build when a user needs them.
