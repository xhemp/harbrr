# harbrr

harbrr is the autobrr family's Torznab/Newznab search provider: it runs the community's
Cardigann tracker definitions through a parity-gated engine and serves the results to the
*arr apps. This glossary is the project's ubiquitous language; architectural design records
live in `docs/architecture.md`.

## Language

### Trackers and definitions

**Definition**:
A declarative Cardigann YAML adapter for one tracker, consumed byte-for-byte from the
vendored Jackett snapshot or a local drop-in.
_Avoid_: config, template, indexer file

**Native driver**:
A Go-built driver for a tracker whose contract exceeds the declarative Cardigann format;
it satisfies the same engine-shaped core the Cardigann engine does.
_Avoid_: custom indexer, plugin

**Family**:
The unit a native driver covers — one API shape, possibly many sites (one Gazelle driver
serves Redacted and Orpheus).
_Avoid_: site, tracker (when the shape is meant)

### Native driver anatomy

**Driver base**:
The shared implementation core every native driver embeds: instance wiring, transport,
redaction, and status classification. A driver adds only its request generator and
response parser.
_Avoid_: base class, common helpers, utils

**Request generator**:
The per-family piece that turns a search query into an authenticated tracker request
(Prowlarr's split).
_Avoid_: query builder

**Response parser**:
The per-family piece that turns a tracker response body into normalized releases
(Prowlarr's split).
_Avoid_: scraper

**Classification dialect**:
An endpoint's mapping from HTTP statuses to meaning — which codes say "credentials bad"
versus "back off" (403 is a spent rate budget on HDBits, an expired session on
MyAnonamouse).
_Avoid_: error mapping, status handling

### Serving

**Grab**:
The server-side fetch of one release's torrent/NZB that the `/dl` proxy drives, so
credentials and passkey-bearing links never reach the *arr client.
_Avoid_: download (for the server-side fetch), snatch

**Rotation**:
A tracker refreshing a session credential on every response; the driver must capture and
persist the new value or the session dies (MyAnonamouse's `mam_id`).
_Avoid_: refresh, renewal

### Process shape

**Composition root**:
`internal/app`, the single place that builds the dependency graph (in a fixed
construction order) and owns process lifecycle (`Run`) and the full-daemon test
handler (`Handler`). `cmd/harbrr` only parses flags and calls it; `internal/server`
only mounts HTTP handlers onto a listener.
_Avoid_: bootstrap, wiring (as a package name), main package logic
