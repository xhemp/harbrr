// searchResponse is the JSON body of GET /api/indexers/{slug}/search. It mirrors qui's
// paged-list envelope: the results for this page plus the paging metadata, so a client
// can page without re-deriving counts. Total is the full match count before the page
// slice; HasMore reports whether results beyond this page exist; Limit/Offset are the
// resolved window. The fields are additive — a pre-reshape consumer reading only
// `results` is unaffected.
