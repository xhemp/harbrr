// Package connresource extracts the lifecycle shared by harbrr's five
// encrypted-secret resources into one generic module: an optional key mint with
// fail-closed orphan revoke plus insert-then-seal on create, a single-tx
// read/hook/patch/rotate/write on update, and a get/delete/fail-closed revoke on
// delete.
//
// Three of the five are connection resources — appsync connections, announce
// connections, notification targets — each a link from harbrr to a remote
// service, two of which mint a dedicated harbrr key the remote side calls back
// with. The other two, proxy and solver, are referenced infra resources: a
// transport or anti-bot endpoint an indexer instance points at, not a
// harbrr-to-remote-service connection, and they mint nothing. Proxy and solver
// adopt Lifecycle for Create and Update only — their Delete stays a bare repo
// delete, since Delete seals no secret (so it carries none of the consolidated
// invariant) and Lifecycle.Delete's Get-then-Delete would change its not-found
// semantics for no benefit.
//
// This is composition, not an object-oriented port. Lifecycle[T] takes plain
// data and first-class functions (CreateSpec/UpdateSpec/DeleteSpec) — the same
// shape as http.Server or errgroup.Group — not an embedded base and not a
// Lifecycler interface: with one implementation an interface is not a seam. There
// is no reflection, no struct tags, no registry. Row operations stay in the
// existing repositories; Lifecycle only sequences them and owns the encryption
// and revoke steps.
//
// Hook tripwire: exactly one optional in-tx hook exists today — appsync's
// sync-profile reference check, on both create and update. If a second or third
// caller wants a hook, that is the signal to stop extending this package and
// redesign, not to grow it into a framework.
