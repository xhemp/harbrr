// Package torznab is the native driver for the torrent-protocol twin of the Newznab
// Torznab API: a tracker whose own search endpoint speaks the Torznab RSS/XML contract
// directly, rather than exposing a Cardigann-compatible HTML/JSON surface. It has no
// Cardigann definition for the same reason the newznab sibling has none — the wire
// format is protocol-level, not a YAML corpus entry — but the acquisition protocol is
// torrent, not usenet: seeders/leechers/peers are meaningful, downloads may be
// credentialed .torrent URLs, and DVF/UVF carry the tracker's freeleech economy. See
// docs/native-indexer-pattern.md for the hard rule this driver exists to enforce: a
// torrent tracker exposing Torznab is NEVER served by the newznab driver, even though
// the wire format would parse.
//
// The family carries a generic user-supplied-URL entry plus the presets Prowlarr's
// Torznab.cs ships as DefaultDefinitions: MoreThanTV (whose Jackett MoreThanTVAPI.cs
// is the parser/request reference — the x-bittorrent enclosure beats <link>, and
// seeders/peers/DVF/UVF get default values when the feed omits them), AnimeTosho
// (public, keyless), and Torrent Network. This driver reproduces that contract and
// reuses every harbrr seam (paced HTTP doer, the secret store, the normalized
// release, the caps mapper, the /dl grab proxy, URL redaction).
