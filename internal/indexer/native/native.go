// Package native hosts indexer drivers for families the declarative Cardigann
// format cannot express — currently only the AvistaZ network, whose login→Bearer
// `api/v1/jackett` auth exceeds the YAML format (so it has 0 vendored defs).
//
// A native driver satisfies Driver — the engine-shaped core the registry's adapter
// wraps, the same contract the Cardigann engine satisfies — so it flows through the
// existing registry caching, health recording, Torznab serializer, and /dl grab
// proxy unchanged. The adapter adds Info + health on top. Each family ships a
// Go-built, caps-only loader.Definition (never schema-validated — it has no
// login/search block) so mapper.Build, the credential store, and the addable-indexer
// list all work without a special case.
