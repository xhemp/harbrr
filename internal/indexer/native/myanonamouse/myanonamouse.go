// Package myanonamouse is the native driver for MyAnonamouse (MAM). It has no
// Cardigann definition because its auth is a rotating `mam_id` session cookie sent
// on every request (the value is refreshed by the server's Set-Cookie on each
// response), which exceeds the declarative format — so the search/parse/grab logic
// lives here in Go. The driver reproduces Prowlarr's documented contract and reuses
// every harbrr seam (paced HTTP client, secret store, normalized release, caps
// mapper, the /dl grab proxy, redaction).

// driver is one configured MyAnonamouse instance. It is built once per instance and

// request); the rotated value is also written back to the encrypted store (see the
// persist field) so the session survives a restart instead of reverting to the seed.
