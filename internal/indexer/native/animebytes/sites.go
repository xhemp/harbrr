// "audio", "gamec[game]", "printedtype[manga]", …) — NOT a synthetic id. That id is what
// MapTorznabCapsToTrackers resolves a requested Newznab category to, and what the request
// builder then emits as "<key>=1"; using anything else makes the server-side category
// filter a silent no-op. All music groups map to the single "audio" key (Prowlarr does not
// split music per-format on the request side; the Lossless/MP3/Other refinement is a
// parse-side concern). gamec[game] / gamec[visual_novel] are each mapped to both Console
// and PC/Games, exactly as Prowlarr registers them, so a request for either Newznab cat
// resolves to the same AB key. The search modes mirror Prowlarr's basic q, EXCEPT
// MusicSearch, which is deliberately omitted (see the Modes block: a native keyword-only
// music query cannot be distinguished from anime and would mis-route).
