// Package iptorrents is the native driver for IPTorrents (IPT). IPTorrents has no
// Cardigann definition because its search surface is an HTML scrape whose column
// layout is resolved dynamically by header text and whose publish dates are
// relative "time ago" strings — logic the declarative YAML format cannot express.
// The driver reproduces Prowlarr's documented contract (IPTorrents.cs:
// IPTorrentsRequestGenerator / IPTorrentsParser) and reuses every harbrr seam
// (paced HTTP client, secret store, normalized release, caps mapper, the /dl grab
// proxy, redaction).
//
// Auth is a session cookie: the user pastes the full browser Cookie string plus a
// matching User-Agent, both sent as headers on every request. Because *arr cannot
// send that cookie, NeedsResolver is true and the served feed routes the download
// through /dl, where this driver's Grab fetches the .torrent server-side.
