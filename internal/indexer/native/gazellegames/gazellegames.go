// Package gazellegames is the native driver for GazelleGames (gazellegames.net), a
// Gazelle-derived games/applications tracker. It has no Cardigann definition because its
// api.php JSON endpoint — an API key carried in the X-API-Key header, numerics
// wire-encoded as JSON strings, a nested group→torrents structure that flattens to one
// release per torrent, and a download URL rebuilt from a server-fetched passkey
// (torrents.php?action=download&torrent_pass=…) — exceeds the declarative format, so the
// search/parse/grab logic lives here in Go. The driver reproduces Prowlarr's documented
// contract (GazelleGames / GazelleGamesRequestGenerator / GazelleGamesParser) and reuses
// every harbrr seam (paced HTTP client, secret store, normalized release, caps mapper,
// the /dl grab proxy, redaction).

// scrub is GazelleGames' own value-scrub, NOT native.Base.Scrub. It shares the same
// two primitives (loader.SecretValues + apphttp.ScrubValues) but cannot go through
// Base.Scrub directly, for two reasons specific to this driver:
//
//   - Base.Scrub reads b.Cfg with no synchronization (Base's documented contract:
//     Cfg is wired once by NewBase and read-only afterwards). GazelleGames is the
//     ONE native driver that breaks that contract — fetchPasskey persists the
//     on-demand download passkey back into Cfg under d.mu, concurrently with a
//     download-URL build reading it — so deriving the scrub set from Cfg must go
//     through the same mutex fetchPasskey's writer uses, or the read races it.
//   - The passkey is not a declared Settings field at all (see credentialSettings:
//     "The download passkey is NOT a user setting"), so loader.SecretValues could
//     never see it via Cfg/Settings regardless of locking — it must be passed
//     explicitly.
//
// The derivation runs over the FULL Cfg under the mutex (loader.SecretValues only
// reads it; the lock is released once every map read is done), so a future secret
// setting added to credentialSettings is picked up automatically rather than
// silently missed by a hand-built key list.

// FetchPasskey before the base probe) so a misconfigured key surfaces immediately and the
// passkey is persisted for later downloads, then issues a cheap latest-torrents search. A
// 401/403 from either step surfaces as login.ErrLoginFailed so the registry records an
// auth_failure health event; neither the apikey nor the passkey is ever logged.
