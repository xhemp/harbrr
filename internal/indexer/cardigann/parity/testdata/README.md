# Parity fixtures

Each subdirectory here is one parity **case**: a `case.yml` spec plus the files it
references. The harness (`../parity.go`, driven by `../parity_test.go`) runs the
real Cardigann engine over the saved bytes — offline, no network — and
byte-compares the canonical JSON it produces against the case's golden.

## Case layout

```text
<case-name>/
  case.yml        # the spec (see fields below)
  definition.yml  # the tracker definition (or use vendor_def to load a vendored one)
  response.html   # a saved response body (parse mode)
  golden.json     # the expected canonical output
```

## `case.yml` fields

- `name` — label (defaults to the directory name)
- `archetype` — the compatibility-matrix row(s) this case covers (required; the
  success-criteria gate asserts every archetype is exercised)
- `golden_source` — provenance of the golden:
  - `jackett-port` — the expected values are Jackett's own test assertions,
    ported verbatim (the authoritative offline oracle)
  - `hand-derived` — values computed by hand from documented Jackett semantics;
    record the derivation reasoning in `description`
- `mode` — `parse` (extract from a saved body; default) or `search` (drive the
  full login + request-building + parse path against a replay transport)
- `definition` / `vendor_def` — set exactly one
- `response` — saved body file (parse mode)
- `steps` — ordered HTTP exchange (search mode): each step's `method` + `url` is
  asserted (request-construction parity) and its `response` body served with
  `status` (default 200), an optional `content_type` (the served `Content-Type`
  header, for the logged-out wire-type gate), and, for a 3xx, `location` (the
  `Location` header).
  Search requests are never auto-followed (Jackett WebClient semantics), so a
  redirect hop appears as its own declared step only when the path opts in via
  `followredirect`. Include any login probe/request the def implies, in
  order — harbrr logs in eagerly (see "Eager login" below).
- `response_type` — override the def's response type (`json` / empty)
- `base_url`, `clock` (RFC3339), `config` (the `.Config` namespace), `query`
- `golden` — golden filename (defaults to `golden.json`)

## Search mode (request-construction parity)

In `search` mode the replay transport is wrapped in a real `*http.Client` with a
cookie jar, so the production login→search cookie flow is exercised offline. The
transport asserts the engine issued **exactly** the declared `steps` (method +
full URL, in order) and fails loud on any unexpected, mismatched, or unconsumed
step — so a search case pins request construction, not just response parsing.

### Eager login (a documented divergence)

harbrr's `EnsureLoggedIn` runs before every search; for a def with a login block
but no `login.test` block it performs the full login sequence (Jackett instead
logs in lazily, only when a search response looks like a login page). So a
search case for such a def must declare the login request(s) as leading steps.
This is an offline-gate divergence; lazy login is handled by the engine.

## Date canonicalization

harbrr emits `publishDate` in its canonical RFC3339 form, whereas Jackett's
`ReleaseInfo.PublishDate` is a `DateTime` it renders as RFC1123Z. Goldens
therefore hold a *translation* of Jackett's value into harbrr's canonical
schema, not Jackett's literal bytes. When porting a Jackett date assertion,
match the **instant** (year/UTC time), never a formatted string, so the
canonical-form choice can never mask an off-by-timezone parse.

## Oracle policy (offline)

Goldens are **not** captured from a live Jackett (project decision; harbrr is
GPL-2.0, same as Jackett, so porting Jackett's own test material is
license-compatible). They come from Jackett's asserted values (`jackett-port`)
or a written hand-derivation (`hand-derived`). Never blindly `-update` a
`jackett-port` golden — the harness refuses it.

The two `jackett-port` oracle cases byte-compare their **whole** `golden.json`,
but only `releases[0]` (and the release count) is anchored to Jackett's own
assertions in `jackett_oracle_test.go`. Releases `[1..N]` of those goldens are a
harbrr regression snapshot, not a Jackett oracle — the `jackett-port` label
covers the count + first release; the remainder is a lock against accidental
change.

## Known divergences from Jackett

These are deliberate or accepted differences from Jackett's Cardigann engine,
documented so a passing gate is honest about what it does and does not match.
None is exercised (and thus hidden) by a fixture authored to dodge it.

**Scope:** this section covers the **engine** layer (a saved tracker response →
normalized release). Output-side differences (the served Torznab/Newznab XML +
the *arr HTTP handler) live in
[`internal/torznab/testdata/README.md`](../../../../torznab/testdata/README.md).
[`docs/divergences.md`](../../../../../docs/divergences.md) is the single index of
both and the shared disposition rule.

Every entry carries an explicit **disposition** so the list is a complete
decision record, not a half-tracked backlog:

- **`[Tracked]`** — a real gap with a GitHub issue tracking it.
- **`[Deliberate]`** — an intentional design choice; not a gap.
- **`[Accepted]`** — a difference we choose to keep (harbrr-additive or
  clean-degradation); no work planned. Revisit only if a vendored def needs it.

Entries:

- **Eager first login + lazy relogin** — harbrr logs in before the FIRST search
  (once per Engine), where Jackett logs in at configure time. This first-login
  divergence is unchanged: a login-bearing search case still declares the login
  request(s) as leading steps. The engine adds the lazy half, both halves of
  Jackett's `CheckIfLoginIsNeeded`: an unfollowed 3xx search response (any
  redirect, for a def with a login block — `matrix-search-redirect-relogin`) or
  a body whose wire `Content-Type` is `text/html` and is missing the `login.test`
  selector triggers exactly one re-login and one retry, matching
  `CheckIfLoginIsNeeded -> DoLogin -> re-request`. Body detection uses `login.test`
  (NOT `login.error`) and gates on the response's actual `Content-Type` header, not
  the def's declared response type — Jackett's `contentType?.Contains("text/html")
  ?? true` (ordinal, case-sensitive; a missing header runs the check). So a def
  declaring `json` that is served a `text/html` login page still relogins
  (`matrix-search-logout-content-type`). The lazy relogin is the added half; the
  eager first login is retained by design. **`[Resolved]`**
- **Search redirects (`followredirect`)** — search requests are never
  auto-followed, matching Jackett's WebClient; a path-level `followredirect:
  true` opts into a manual follow (≤5 bare-GET hops, magnet stops the loop —
  `matrix-search-redirect-follow`), and the definition-level flag applies to
  login/landing flows only (harbrr's login client always follows: a documented
  superset). An unfollowed non-XML 3xx runs Jackett's `CheckIfLoginIsNeeded`:
  login defs relogin + retry once (`matrix-search-redirect-relogin`); no-login
  defs get Jackett's unconditional single re-request (the 302's Set-Cookie
  rides the jar) and the second response parses as-is; XML paths skip the check
  entirely (Jackett's XML branch has no login check). Deliberate tails:
  - **Cookie-carrying hops** — Jackett's SEARCH-path `FollowIfRedirect` issues
    hops with NO cookies (an anonymous WebRequest), landing a logged-in def's
    redirected search on the login page (0 releases). harbrr's hops carry the
    session cookies + solver UA — the additive behavior the
    followredirect+login defs (kinozal, selezen, bjshare, hhanclub) actually
    want; the production client's jar could not be bypassed per-request anyway.
    **`[Accepted]`**
  - **Cross-domain redirects** — Jackett throws "Got redirected to another
    domain"; harbrr does not inspect the target domain (the logged-out signal /
    re-request covers it). **`[Accepted]`**
  - **Persistent redirect after relogin** — a login def still redirected after
    the bounded relogin retry surfaces an error where Jackett would parse the
    redirect body (0 releases, silent); harbrr's error is the more diagnosable
    outcome and the retry stays bounded either way. **`[Accepted]`**
  - **308 + Refresh-header pseudo-redirects** — Jackett's `WebResult.IsRedirect`
    omits 308 (harbrr treats it like 301; no corpus def emits one) and counts
    ANY response with a `Refresh` header as a redirect, including the obsolete
    Cloudflare 503+Refresh interstitial (harbrr classifies a 503 as
    rate-limited; modern anti-bot interstitials are the solver boundary's job).
    **`[Accepted]`**

  **`[Resolved]`**
- **Non-2xx search-status handling** — harbrr's search path fails fast on a
  non-redirect non-2xx response (`search/request.go` `checkStatus`): 429/503
  become the typed `RateLimitedError` the registry backs off on, and any other
  status (403/404/500…) is a loud `tracker returned HTTP <n>` error — the tracker
  errored, so the body is not results and silently parsing it would surface a
  misleading empty page. Jackett does the opposite on this path: its HTML branch
  parses ANY-status body (only `checkForError`'s `401` gate + the def's error
  selectors throw) and its XML branch has no status check at all, so a parseable
  page served with a 403/404/500 yields results/0-releases there. The **redirect
  half** of Jackett's `CheckIfLoginIsNeeded` is preserved (see "Search redirects"
  above): an unfollowed 3xx is surfaced as data, so a login page served as a
  **302** still relogins. The known limitation is the non-redirect case — a login
  page served with a **403** (body-based logout, no redirect) hard-fails in harbrr
  where Jackett parses the body — and relogins if the def has a `login.test`
  selector that is absent, or otherwise just yields 0 rows; either way Jackett does
  not hard-fail. No
  offline corpus fixture carries a non-2xx search status (per CLAUDE.md the parity
  target is Jackett's output on saved fixtures), so this is a live-only difference;
  the JSON branch is unaffected (Jackett's JSON branch also throws on non-200, so
  harbrr already matches it). Gated by `search/ratelimit_test.go`
  (`TestDoSearchRequest_Non2xxFailsFast`, `TestDoSearchRequest_RateLimitedStatus`).
  **`[Deliberate]`**
- **Date canonical form** — RFC3339 vs Jackett's RFC1123Z; see "Date
  canonicalization". Same instant, different string — a canonical-schema choice,
  not a parse difference. **`[Deliberate]`**
- **Unitless integer sizes parsed exactly** — Jackett routes even an
  already-exact raw byte count (a selector like `data-size-bytes="94329473840"`)
  through its float32 `GetBytes`/`BytesFrom*` chain, quantizing large values
  (off by up to the float32 step — 8 KiB at ~90 GB; Jackett#16959, the same loss
  Prowlarr#2740 reports). harbrr's `parseSize` instead parses a unitless plain
  integer with `strconv.ParseInt` and returns it losslessly, because the value
  is already the final byte count and downstream byte-equality matching (e.g.
  cross-seed) breaks on the quantized form (autobrr/harbrr#275). Unit-bearing
  (`1.5 GB`), decimal (`123.5`), and overflowing values keep the float32 parity
  chain unchanged — truncation and MaxInt64 clamp included. Gated by
  `normalizer_test.go` `TestParseSize` (the "raw bytes …" cases pin the exact
  path; "decimal raw bytes truncate" and "raw bytes overflow clamps" pin the
  retained parity fallback). **`[Deliberate]`**
- **URL encoding (`.NET WebUtility.UrlEncode`)** — Resolved. Both the
  GET-query encoder (`encodeOrdered`) and the search-path value encoder now route
  through `internal/indexer/cardigann/internal/encode`, which reproduces .NET
  `WebUtility.UrlEncode` (the encoder Jackett uses for both halves of a request:
  `StringUtil.GetQueryString` → `WebUtilityHelpers.UrlEncode` for the query, and
  `applyGoTemplateText(..., WebUtility.UrlEncode)` + `Replace("+","%20")` for the
  path). Verified against the dotnet/runtime `WebUtility` source: the literal set
  is `A-Za-z0-9-_.!*()`, so the divergence from Go's `url.QueryEscape` is exactly
  five characters — `! * ( )` (Go escapes them; .NET leaves them literal) and `~`
  (Go leaves it literal; .NET escapes it to `%7E`). The apostrophe `'` is `%27` in
  BOTH engines and was NOT a divergence (the earlier note here wrongly listed it
  and omitted `~`). Spaces match (`%20` in the path, `+` in the query). The magnet
  synthesizer (in `internal/indexer/cardigann/normalizer`) uses `encode.WebUtilityStringEncode`
  — the .NET WebUtility *STRING* form that leaves the sub-delimiters `! * ( )`
  LITERAL — because `MagnetUtil.InfoHashToPublicMagnet` builds `dn=`/`tr=` via
  `WebUtilityHelpers.UrlEncode` → `WebUtility.UrlEncodeToBytes` (safe set includes
  `! * ( )`), and the synthesised magnet is Torznab OUTPUT, not an on-the-wire
  tracker request. The request encoders keep the on-the-wire form (percent-encoded
  `! * ( )`); the difference is only those four chars in `dn=` (a "Title (Year)"
  emits `dn=…+(Year)` in both engines). **`[Resolved]`** Login form-POST
  bodies remain on stdlib `url.Values.Encode` — a deliberate divergence, see
  `login/methods.go` (`postForm`) and `login/encoding_divergence_test.go`.
- **`.Today.Month` / `.Today.Day`** — harbrr exposes these template fields;
  Jackett seeds only `.Today.Year`. A def referencing them gets a real value in
  harbrr and `""` in Jackett. No vendored def uses them, and the extra fields are
  additive. **`[Accepted]`**
- **`leechers` field** — harbrr's canonical release includes `leechers`; Jackett's
  `ReleaseInfo` tracks only `Peers` (= seeders + leechers). A harbrr convenience
  field (useful for downstream Torznab output) with no Jackett equivalent.
  **`[Accepted]`**
- **Category ordering** — harbrr sorts a release's categories ascending (a
  deliberate determinism choice for stable goldens); Jackett's `Category` is a
  list in insertion order. They agree whenever insertion order is already
  ascending (as in the JSON oracle, `[2000, 100001]`); a mapping that inserted a
  custom cat before a standard one would differ in order only.
  **`[Accepted]`**
- **`rows.attribute` missing without `MissingAttributeEqualsNoResults`** — when a
  JSON row lacks the `rows.attribute` sub-object, harbrr skips that row; Jackett
  dereferences null and aborts the whole query unless the flag is set. harbrr
  degrades cleanly in both cases (only `yts.yml` pairs the two, with the flag on),
  consistent with the project's clean-degradation stance.
  **`[Accepted]`**
- **Download resolver scope** — Resolved. `ResolveDownload` now
  reproduces Jackett's full `CardigannIndexer.Download`: the `.DownloadUri` template
  namespace (populated from the link, .NET `System.Uri` semantics — see the URI
  divergence note below), `before.inputs`/`before.pathselector` (inputs as an
  ordered GET query / POST body honouring `queryseparator`; pathselector GETs the
  link and replaces `before.path`), Go-template evaluation of the download selector
  string, `download.infohash`→magnet (shared `magnet` package, byte-for-byte
  MagnetUtil), `download.method: post` + `download.headers` on the grab fetch, and
  `testlinktorrent` (default TRUE; non-magnet links fetched and accepted only if the
  first byte is `d`). Fixtures: `matrix-download-link`, `matrix-download-before-post`,
  and the `search/download_test.go` recording-doer suite (which pins the POST body
  the replay harness cannot). **`[Resolved]`**
- **.DownloadUri vs .NET System.Uri canonicalization** — `NewDownloadURI` maps
  Go's `*url.URL` onto the .NET `System.Uri` members real defs read
  (`.Query.<k>`, `.AbsolutePath`, `.AbsoluteUri`, `.PathAndQuery`) byte-for-byte for
  the URL shapes the corpus produces (`path?id=NNN`, `/info/NNN`). It deliberately
  does NOT reproduce .NET's URI *canonicalization* that no corpus def exercises:
  stripping a default `:80`/`:443`, lowercasing the host, compacting dot-segments,
  or unescaping percent-encoded unreserved octets in the path. A def needing those
  routes through the existing encode/regex layers. It is exact for the corpus; the
  exotic canonicalization is unhit. **`[Accepted]`**
- **XML backend** — Resolved. harbrr parses `response.type: xml` into an
  element tree and queries it with cascadia; Jackett uses AngleSharp's `XmlParser`.
  The common RSS/Newznab shapes (`<item>`, `<title>`, `<link>`, `torznab:attr`) and
  the edge cases now match AngleSharp's **selectable output**, pinned by fixtures
  (`selector/xml_test.go` + parity `matrix-xml-cdata`):
  - **CDATA** content is literal (`&`/`<…>` are character data, not markup) and text
    abutting a CDATA section concatenates, including for a `:contains` selector
    spanning the boundary — AngleSharp's `CDATASection : Text` coalesces the same way.
  - **comments** are dropped before the tree; AngleSharp keeps a comment as a node but
    a comment is non-text, so `.TextContent`/`:contains` exclude it in both — the
    selectable output is identical (an implementation difference, not a divergence).
  - a **default namespace** (`xmlns=…`) element is selectable by its bare local name.
  - **nested/redeclared prefixes** resolve per scope without leaking into siblings.
  - an **undeclared prefix** parses leniently (Strict=false) and stays selectable by
    its qualified name; Jackett's default `new XmlParser()` is also lenient, so this is
    a robustness property, not a divergence.

  harbrr selects namespaced elements by their **qualified** name (`prefix\:local`),
  the form every vendored def uses; selecting a namespaced element by a bare local
  name is neither used by the corpus nor pinned here. **`[Resolved]`**
- **`:has` / `:contains` selector shims** — the `:has` and `:contains` pseudo-classes
  (used by Cardigann to filter rows and map case keys) resolve correctly end to end in
  both HTML (cascadia) and JSON (`selector/jsonpseudo.go`) response modes, pinned by
  `parity/testdata/stress-selector-shims` (HTML) and `stress-json-has` (JSON) plus the
  `selector` unit tests. The case divergence — **`:contains` was case-INSENSITIVE in
  cascadia but case-SENSITIVE in AngleSharp** (Jackett), so harbrr matched a strict
  superset (wrong first-match `case:` arms, over-eager `remove:`) — is Resolved:
  `compileCSS` rewrites every `:contains(x)` to cascadia's `:matches(...)` with a
  literal-quoted pattern (`selector/contains.go`), which evaluates against the same
  concatenated descendant text without lowercasing, reproducing AngleSharp's ordinal
  `TextContent.Contains`. The rewrite applies wherever `:contains` appears, including
  inside `:has(...)`/`:not(...)`; case-sensitivity is pinned by the `selector`
  `contains_test.go` suite. **`[Resolved]`**
- **JSON date auto-conversion (Newtonsoft)** — Resolved. Jackett parses
  JSON with Newtonsoft's default `DateParseHandling.DateTime`, so an ISO-8601
  string VALUE becomes a `DateTime` rendered back as the .NET InvariantCulture
  string `MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss`; Go's `encoding/json` keeps the raw ISO string. The
  JSON selector now reproduces this for ISO strings with a `T` separator
  (`selector/jsonpath.go`), which is what every UNIT3D-API def's `created_at`
  (`append " +00:00"` → `dateparse "MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss zzz"`) relies on. Surfaced
  by the live smoke. **`[Resolved]`**
- **Whitespace-only value collapse** — the template engine collapses a
  whitespace-ONLY string value (`" "`, `"\t"`) to `""` on every read path before
  rendering (`template/template.go` `normalizeWhitespaceValues`), so bare
  `{{ if .X }}` truthiness matches Jackett's `!IsNullOrWhiteSpace`. Jackett applies
  that rule ONLY in if/else conditions and keeps the RAW value in interpolation and
  in `eq`/`ne` (a raw string compare). So for a whitespace-only carrier the collapse
  also diverges on those paths: `a{{ .Config.sep }}b` with `sep=" "` renders `ab`
  (Jackett `a b`), and `eq .Query.IMDBID .False` with `IMDBID=" "` takes the
  true/`onTrue` branch (Jackett raw-compares `" " != null` → `onFalse`). It bites
  only whitespace-ONLY `.Query.Q` / `.Config.*` / `.Result.*` (`.Keywords` is
  pre-trimmed upstream); no vendored def or offline golden produces such a value, so
  the gate is unaffected. A faithful split (raw interpolation + raw `eq` +
  whitespace-aware `if`) would mean rebuilding Jackett's regex mini-engine instead of
  delegating truthiness to Go's `text/template`; not justified for this degenerate
  edge. Pinned by `template/template_test.go`
  (`TestEvalWhitespaceCollapseIsDeliberate`). **`[Deliberate]`**
- **Login status vs error selectors** — Jackett never fails a login on HTTP
  status; it relies on the def's error selectors. harbrr matches this for
  `get`/`cookie` logins (a `401` probe is not a failure — e.g. DigitalCore's apikey
  is an `X-API-KEY` header carried by the SEARCH request, not the login probe), but
  retains a stricter `401`→fail for credential-submitting `form`/`post` logins as a
  useful, result-neutral early bad-credentials signal. **`[Resolved]`**
