//     an indexer for the operator's dead network or a gateway hiccup.
//     ponytail: harbrr's transport kind lumps connection/DNS/EOF/gateway together
//     (#223, #247) rather than Prowlarr's separate connection-failure category, so
//     the whole kind is treated as non-escalating here. Split it if gateway-vs-DNS
//     ever needs different backoff.
//   - every other classified kind (auth, anti-bot, rate-limited, parse) climbs one
//     rung, capped at maxCircuitLevel.
//   - retryAfter (non-zero only for a rate-limited failure carrying Retry-After) is a
//     hard floor on the resulting disable window.
//   - a failure landing within startupGrace of the registry's boot is capped to
//     startupGraceCap regardless of rung.
