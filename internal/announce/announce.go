// Package announce pushes harbrr's newly-seen releases to cross-seed tools (qui
// cross-seed + cross-seed v6) so a tracker harbrr already polls feeds cross-seed with no
// second poll. harbrr is only the messenger — the cross-seed tools do the matching. The
// .torrent is fetched (qui) or linked (cross-seed v6) only on a confirmed match, so this
// is strictly less tracker load than a consumer polling + grabbing. Secrets — the tool's
// API key and harbrr's apikey-bearing /dl link — are redacted in logs and never echoed in
// errors.
