// exposes an `all` root for broad (prefix-matching) invalidation plus finer keys
// that spread from it. Key VALUES match what was already in use — this file only
// centralizes and types them, it does not change what gets cached under what key.
//
// indexers vs indexerStats are deliberately separate top-level domains (not
// indexers.stats(slug) nested under "indexers") so an indexer whose slug is
// literally "stats" can never share a cache entry with the aggregate stats query.
// That collision existed once (fixed 2026-07-09, see
// web/src/hooks/useAllIndexerStats.test.tsx) — this split makes it structurally
// impossible to reintroduce through the registry.
