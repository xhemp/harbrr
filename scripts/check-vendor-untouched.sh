# Pre-commit + CI guard: refuse hand-edits to the vendored Jackett definition
# snapshot under internal/indexer/definitions/vendor/. Those files are consumed
# byte-for-byte from Jackett; behavioral differences belong in the engine, upstream
# in Jackett, or in internal/indexer/definitions/dropin/ — never here. Refresh the
# whole snapshot with `make vendor-defs` (the scheduled vendor-definitions workflow).
# See AGENTS.md.
#
# This is the tool-agnostic enforcement: it runs in CI (authoritative, non-bypassable
# once required in branch protection) and as a pre-commit hook, so the rule holds no
# matter which editor/agent a contributor uses.
#
#   (no args)  scan the staged diff                  — pre-commit
#   --ci       scan the PR diff vs its base branch    — CI (pre-commit can be skipped)
