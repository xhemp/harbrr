# Features

Everything harbrr does today, and everything it's going to do.

harbrr is a single Go binary that speaks Torznab and Newznab. You point Sonarr, Radarr, and
friends at it; it searches your trackers and hands back results. It reads the same Cardigann
tracker definitions Jackett and Prowlarr use — **byte-for-byte, straight from the upstream
snapshot** — so behavioural parity on the same input is the project's standing correctness gate,
not an aspiration.

Status key:

- ✅ **Shipped** — built, tested, and in the binary today.
- 🚧 **Pending** — designed and tracked, not built yet. Each links to its issue.

## What harbrr does that Prowlarr and Jackett don't

These are the differences that motivated building harbrr rather than contributing to what
already exists. Every one of them is shipped today.

### A real search-results cache ✅

harbrr remembers recent answers, and a cache hit means **the request never reaches your tracker
at all**. This matters more than a client-side cache because harbrr *is* the search server — it
sits at the one point in the chain where a duplicate request can actually be stopped.

It's not a naive key-value store:

- **Tiered TTLs** — RSS polls, keyword searches, and thin result sets each expire on their own
  schedule, because they go stale at different rates.
- **Stale-while-revalidate** — a nearly-expired entry is served immediately while a refresh runs
  behind it, so nobody waits on a cache boundary.
- **Negative caching** — "no results" is an answer worth remembering too.
- **Honest accounting** — harbrr counts the tracker requests it *prevented*, so you can see what
  the cache is actually buying you rather than taking it on faith.

The everyday case this fixes: two Sonarr instances (one 1080p, one 4K) polling the same tracker
for the same thing, forever. One tracker request instead of two, every cycle.

→ **[Search-results cache](search-results-cache.md)**

### Per-indexer request budgets, with reactive learning ✅

Set a query and grab limit per indexer, per day or per hour, and harbrr enforces it. The part
nobody else does: when a tracker tells harbrr it has hit a quota, harbrr **learns that cap and
respects it from then on** — even with no configuration at all. A budget-exhausted indexer prefers
serving a slightly stale cached result over going dark, and it is never mistaken for a broken
indexer.

### One tracker config, both your \*arrs and cross-seed ✅

harbrr treats cross-seed as a first-class consumer rather than something to be worked around. It
generates the cross-seed configuration for you, and a per-indexer freeleech toggle plus announce
push round it out. Configure the tracker once.

→ **[Cross-seed & freeleech](cross-seed-freeleech.md)**

### qui and autobrr as sync targets ✅

harbrr pushes indexer configuration into **qui** alongside the usual Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr/
Readarr/Whisparr targets, and pushes releases to autobrr. harbrr is built for the autobrr family,
so its own family's tools are supported rather than being someone else's feature request.

→ **[App Sync](../guides/app-sync.md)**

### Honest pagination ✅

When something walks the feed page by page, harbrr returns stable, non-duplicating pages and
truthful counts — including the awkward cases (an offset past the end, a partial final page).
Quietly repeating or dropping releases across page boundaries is a silent data-loss bug, and it's
tested against explicitly.

→ **[Pagination](pagination.md)**

### A single binary ✅

No .NET runtime, no separate frontend service. One Go binary, SQLite, and a data directory.

## The full picture

### Search & serving

| Feature | Status |
|---|:--|
| Torznab + Newznab endpoints per indexer | ✅ |
| Cardigann engine at parity with the upstream definition format | ✅ |
| **578 trackers** — 552 Cardigann definitions + 26 native Go drivers | ✅ |
| Native drivers for trackers Cardigann can't express (AvistaZ family, Gazelle, HDBits, PTP, BTN, MAM, FileList, IPTorrents, Nebulance, AnimeBytes, GazelleGames, BeyondHD, TorrentDay, NZBIndex, …) | ✅ |
| Usenet (Newznab) indexers alongside torrents | ✅ |
| Search-results cache with tiered TTLs, SWR, and negative caching | ✅ |
| Failing-tracker circuit breaker | ✅ |
| Per-host rate limiting, honouring definition `requestDelay` and `Retry-After` | ✅ |
| Per-indexer request + grab budgets with reactive learning | ✅ |
| Correct pagination and result counts on the feed | ✅ |
| Partial results — a failing indexer degrades its own contribution, never the whole search | ✅ |
| ID-based search (IMDb/TMDb/TVDB) and category mapping | ✅ |
| Multi-select definition settings (checkbox / select / multi-select field types) | ✅ |
| 17 further native drivers | 🚧 |
| Per-indexer request timeout — a reserved `timeout` duration setting on every indexer's advanced options | ✅ |
| Automatic failover across a tracker's known base URLs — only on host-shaped failure, never on an auth or rate-limit error, and a candidate must pass a real search before it is promoted; the configured host is never overwritten | ✅ |
| Per-indexer required release flags (freeleech, halfleech, …) | 🚧 [#385](https://github.com/autobrr/harbrr/issues/385) |
| Per-release language and subtitle attributes from definitions | 🚧 [#379](https://github.com/autobrr/harbrr/issues/379) |
| Out-of-band definition updates — tracker fixes arrive without waiting for a harbrr release | 🚧 [#388](https://github.com/autobrr/harbrr/issues/388) |
| Tri-state indexer health — healthy / failing / unknown, where unknown means never tested; a broken tracker leaves rotation and costs nothing until it recovers | ✅ |
| Indexer usage beside health — query count and last-query age in the indexer table, a **Never queried** state for an indexer nothing is using, and an **Idle indexers** dashboard tile (never queried, or quiet for more than 7 days) | ✅ |
| Per-failure-kind backoff curves — a dead network is not punished like a dead tracker — plus `status:healthy` aggregate feeds that skip indexers known to be broken | ✅ |
| Punctuation-tolerant matching (opt-in, per indexer) — recovers releases that \*arr-stripped search terms would otherwise drop | ✅ |
| Degenerate-query gating (opt-in, per indexer) — a search the indexer's own filters strip down to a bare year is skipped instead of sent, and reported as skipped rather than failed | ✅ |
| Aggregate `all` feed — one Torznab URL over every enabled indexer, partial-by-construction with a per-member status ledger; grabs resolve against the originating tracker | ✅ |
| Profile-scoped aggregate feeds — `profile:<name>` serves a sync profile's indexers over one URL | ✅ |
| Health-filtered aggregate feeds — `status:healthy` serves every enabled indexer that isn't currently failing (healthy *and* not-yet-known, so a brand-new indexer is searched rather than hidden) over one URL | ✅ |

### Getting past the tracker's front door

| Feature | Status |
|---|:--|
| Cookie, form, and API-key login flows | ✅ |
| FlareSolverr integration for Cloudflare-guarded trackers | ✅ |
| HTTP and SOCKS proxy support, per indexer | ✅ |

### Apps & download clients

| Feature | Status |
|---|:--|
| App Sync to Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Readarr, Whisparr | ✅ |
| App Sync to **qui** | ✅ |
| Synced indexers keep the name you gave them — no forced suffix appended, and renames survive re-sync | ✅ |
| Cross-seed configuration generation | ✅ |
| Unfiltered `/full` feed variant — cross-seed sees the whole catalog while your \*arrs keep the freeleech-only view, no duplicate indexer config | ✅ |
| Release push to autobrr | ✅ |
| **10 download-client drivers** — qBittorrent, Deluge, Transmission, rTorrent, Flood, Synology Download Station, NZBGet, SABnzbd, qui, and blackhole | ✅ |
| Interactive search in harbrr's own UI, with working downloads | ✅ |
| [Send a search result straight to a download client](download-clients.md) | ✅ |

| Indexer, application, and download-client management | ✅ |
| Interactive search, with a responsive mobile layout | ✅ |
| Instant substring / regex filter over search results | ✅ |
| Search runs on the same merged window and per-member ledger the feeds serve — sort and counts can never disagree with your \*arrs, and an indexer that sat one out says why (circuit open, budget exhausted, rate limited, timed out) | ✅ |
| Global sort across merged multi-indexer results (via the aggregate feed) | ✅ |
| Group identical releases across indexers, with per-tracker sources attached | ✅ |
| Base-URL picker — choose from the definition's known hosts, with a free-text escape hatch for private mirrors | ✅ |
| Cache dashboard — tracker requests saved, hit ratio, cache size, entry ages, breaker countdowns, live-tunable TTL tiers | ✅ |
| Selectable stats window on the cache dashboard — 24h / 7d / 30d / all-time, with a reset that clears the statistics without discarding cached results | ✅ |
| Request-budget usage meters — per-indexer queries and grabs against the account's cap, with the detected-vs-operator-set provenance shown | ✅ |
| Global setting to hide adult categories (pickers and uncategorised searches; filters by declared category) | ✅ |

### Visibility

| Feature | Status |
|---|:--|
| Per-indexer stats — queries, grabs, average latency, last query/failure | ✅ |
| Failures broken out by cause — auth, rate limit, parse, anti-bot, transport | ✅ |
| Per-indexer cache stats, including tracker requests prevented | ✅ |
| Discord and webhook notifications | ✅ |
| Search history and an event log | 🚧 [#103](https://github.com/autobrr/harbrr/issues/103) |
| Grab success rate and per-category indexer stats | ✅ |
| Indexer uniqueness scoring — which indexers surface releases nobody else has | 🚧 [#378](https://github.com/autobrr/harbrr/issues/378) |
| [VIP & membership expiry](vip-expiry.md) — per-indexer dates, lead-time warnings that fire exactly once, renewal re-arms by itself | ✅ |
| Newznab API-limit auto-discovery — an unset cap is seeded from the account's own advertised daily limits, and a value you typed is never overwritten | ✅ |
| Per-tracker account state — ratio, buffer, hit-and-run, freeleech tokens | 🚧 deferred — [#393](https://github.com/autobrr/harbrr/issues/393) |
| Parse-failure diagnostics — the last five failed exchanges per indexer, kept in a ring so you can see which selector missed without re-fetching | ✅ |
| Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint | 🚧 [#395](https://github.com/autobrr/harbrr/issues/395) |

### Operating it

| Feature | Status |
|---|:--|
| Single binary, SQLite, Docker image | ✅ |

[^1]: Prowlarr caches one narrow case (repeated anime-batch requests, for a few minutes). A
general search-results cache has been requested repeatedly and declined as low-benefit.

[^2]: Prowlarr's cross-seed workaround is to configure the same tracker twice — once filtered,
once not — which duplicates credentials, health state, and rate-limit pressure for one account.

[^3]: Prowlarr has a fixed 100-second global timeout. Making it configurable per indexer is its
single most-upvoted open request.

[^4]: Jackett ships an aggregate feed (`/api/v2.0/indexers/all/results/torznab`) and its own
documentation recommends against using it — one slow or dead indexer stalls or degrades the whole
search. Prowlarr has no aggregate Torznab endpoint. harbrr's is partial by construction: a failing
member contributes nothing, never fails the request, and is named in a per-member status ledger on
the feed itself.

**Where Prowlarr is still ahead:** it is a mature project with years of production use, a large
community, and integrations harbrr hasn't built yet. harbrr is younger and pre-1.0. What harbrr
offers is the same tracker corpus with better behaviour at the points that cost you tracker
goodwill — caching, budgets, and rate limiting — plus first-class support for the autobrr family.
