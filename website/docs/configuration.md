# Configuration

harbrr reads configuration from a TOML file, environment variables, and command-line flags.
**Every value is optional** — the defaults below are what harbrr uses when a key is omitted.

## The config file: `<data-dir>/config.toml`

On first run, `harbrr serve` creates a commented starter **`config.toml` in the data
directory, right beside the SQLite database** (in the Docker image that's
`/config/config.toml`), and reads it from there on every start:

- The file is created `0600` with the defaults filled in; harbrr **never overwrites your
  edits** — it only writes the file when it doesn't exist yet.
- **Changes take effect on restart.** The startup log's `config_file=` field names the file
  that was actually loaded, so there's no guessing where a value came from.
- `--config <path>` points harbrr at an explicit file anywhere instead (the extension picks
  the format); the auto-generated file is skipped entirely in that case.
- `data_dir` itself can only be set by flag (`--data-dir`) or environment
  (`HARBRR_DATA_DIR`) — the auto-discovered file lives *inside* the data directory, so it
  can't relocate it.

The starter template covers the settings operators actually reach for (`[server]`, `[log]`,
`[auth]`, `[secrets]`); **any** key documented on this page works in the same file. The
exhaustive, commented reference is
[`config.example.toml`](https://github.com/autobrr/harbrr/blob/main/config.example.toml)
in the repo.

## Precedence and environment variables

Precedence is **command-line flag > environment variable > config file > default**.

Environment variables are `HARBRR_`-prefixed with dots replaced by underscores:

| Config key        | Environment variable          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `server.port`     | `HARBRR_SERVER_PORT`          |
| `auth.mode`       | `HARBRR_AUTH_MODE`            |
| `log.level`       | `HARBRR_LOG_LEVEL`            |

List-valued keys (`auth.ip_allowlist`, `auth.trusted_proxies`) can only be set in the
config file, not via environment variables.

!!! note "Runtime-tunable cache knobs"
    The `cache.*` values below are the **boot defaults**. Every one of them can also be
    changed at runtime — without a restart — via `GET`/`PUT /api/cache/config`. See the
    [search-results cache](features/search-results-cache.md) page.

## `[server]`

```toml
[server]
host = "127.0.0.1"       # listen host; use 0.0.0.0 in a container
port = 7478
base_url = ""            # serve under a subpath, e.g. "/harbrr" (no trailing slash)
secure_cookie = false    # set true when reached over HTTPS (TLS-terminating proxy)
```

Set `secure_cookie = true` whenever harbrr is reached over HTTPS (for example behind a
TLS-terminating reverse proxy) so the session cookie carries the `Secure` attribute.

!!! tip "Changing the port"
    Edit `port` in `<data-dir>/config.toml` and restart. Connection cards on the
    Applications page flag app-sync URLs whose explicit port no longer matches the
    configured one, with a guided fix — see the note there about reverse proxies and
    Docker port mappings before applying it.

## `[log]`

```toml
[log]
level = "info"           # trace | debug | info | warn | error
format = "console"       # console | json
```

## `data_dir` and `[database]`

```toml
data_dir = "./data"      # data directory (created 0700); holds the db + keyfile
[database]
path = ""                # SQLite path; defaults to <data_dir>/harbrr.db
```

harbrr is SQLite-only. The data directory is created `0700`; the database and its
`-wal`/`-journal` side files are `0600`. As noted above, these two keys only take effect
from a file passed via `--config`.

## `[secrets]`

```toml
[secrets]
encryption_key = ""      # inline 32-byte key (hex or base64); prefer key_file/env
key_file = ""            # path to a 32-byte key file (raw or hex/base64 encoded)
allow_plaintext = false  # opt into UNENCRYPTED storage; otherwise harbrr fails closed
```

Encryption of tracker credentials is **always on**. With no key configured, harbrr
auto-generates a keyfile at `<data_dir>/.keys/harbrr.key` (`0600`) on first run.

!!! warning "Back up the keyfile"
    Back the keyfile up **separately** from the database — losing it means re-entering every
    tracker credential. To store secrets unencrypted you must explicitly set
    `allow_plaintext = true`; otherwise harbrr fails closed and emits a loud warning.

## `[auth]`

```toml
[auth]
mode = "required"        # "required" (login) or "disabled" (trust a reverse proxy)
ip_allowlist = []        # e.g. ["10.0.0.0/8", "192.168.1.5"]
trusted_proxies = []     # peers whose X-Forwarded-For is trusted, e.g. ["172.16.0.0/12"]
```

- **`required`** (default) — operators log in; the management API needs a session or an API key.
- **`disabled`** — harbrr trusts an authenticating reverse proxy and serves a synthetic admin
  to allowlisted client IPs. This mode **requires a non-empty `ip_allowlist`**.

Set `trusted_proxies` to the proxy peers whose `X-Forwarded-For` harbrr should trust when
resolving the client IP.

## `[cache]`

```toml
[cache]
enabled = true           # set false to disable caching entirely (zero behavior change)
rss_ttl = "5m"           # TTL for an empty/RSS poll
keyword_ttl = "30m"      # TTL for a real keyword/id search
thin_ttl = "2m"          # shorter TTL when a search returns few results
thin_threshold = 5       # result count at/below which thin_ttl applies (only shortens)
refresh_ahead_pct = 80   # serve cached + refresh once past this % of the TTL
cleanup_interval = "1h"  # how often expired entries are reaped
```

These are the boot defaults; all are runtime-tunable via `PUT /api/cache/config`. The
[search-results cache](features/search-results-cache.md) page explains each knob in depth.

## Tracker-friendly pacing (automatic)

harbrr fronts **every** outbound request — Cardigann and native drivers, the capabilities
probe, and `/dl` downloads — with a process-wide, **per-host** rate limiter, so the aggregate
rate harbrr presents to a tracker stays polite no matter how many apps (or app *instances*)
sit behind it. The rate is taken from each definition's own `requestDelay` (or a 1-second
default), `429`/`503` responses are honored with bounded backoff, and the strictest limit for
a host wins. This needs no configuration and pairs with the
[search-results cache](features/search-results-cache.md) and
[circuit breaker](features/circuit-breaker.md) as the third "kind to trackers" layer.

A user-configurable global/per-indexer rate override is deferred (the per-host limiter is the
v1 mechanism); per-indexer `timeout` and proxy settings are set when you
[add an indexer](guides/add-indexer.md).

## What stays in the config file (by design)

Deploy-time and security-sensitive settings are deliberately **not** runtime-tunable: the
data directory, database path, listen address, base URL, the encryption key (it must stay
out of the database it protects), and the auth mode / IP allowlist / trusted proxies. Change
those in the config file (or environment) and restart.
