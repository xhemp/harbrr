# Harbrr

> The tracker and indexer fabric for the autobrr ecosystem.

Harbrr is a modern tracker and indexer management platform built for autobrr, qui, cross-seed, and private tracker power users.

It provides a centralized layer between your trackers and automation applications, allowing you to manage trackers once, reduce unnecessary tracker load, aggregate RSS feeds, optimize searches, and expose a unified Torznab interface to the entire *arr ecosystem.

While Harbrr is built with the autobrr ecosystem in mind, it remains fully compatible with Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Readarr, Mylar, Whisparr, and any Torznab-capable application.

---

## Why Harbrr?

Most indexer managers were designed around the *arr ecosystem and later integrated with autobrr.

Harbrr takes the opposite approach.

Harbrr is being built for modern private tracker workflows from day one, with native consideration for autobrr, qui, cross-seed, and tracker-friendly automation practices while maintaining seamless compatibility with existing *arr applications.

The goal isn't simply to proxy searches.

The goal is to become the intelligent layer between automation applications and trackers.

## Key Features

### Centralized Tracker Management

Configure your trackers once.

Harbrr provides a single source of truth for tracker configuration, authentication, capabilities, categories, and search behavior across your automation stack.

No more duplicating tracker setup across multiple applications.

---

### Shared RSS Feed Caching

Private trackers are a shared resource.

Today, multiple applications often poll the same tracker for nearly identical information.

Harbrr introduces centralized RSS aggregation and caching so that tracker data can be fetched once and reused across your entire ecosystem.

Benefits include:

- Reduced tracker load
- Fewer duplicate requests
- Faster downstream processing
- Better private tracker citizenship
- Improved scalability for larger automation stacks

---

### Intelligent Search Deduplication

A single release can trigger multiple searches from multiple applications.

Instead of repeatedly sending identical searches to the same tracker, Harbrr is designed to intelligently reuse cached results whenever possible.

This reduces:

- Duplicate tracker queries
- API consumption
- Search latency
- Unnecessary tracker traffic

---

### Built for autobrr

Harbrr is designed to complement autobrr workflows rather than simply coexist with them.

Planned integrations and workflow optimizations include:

- Shared tracker intelligence
- Smarter RSS processing
- Release reuse across applications
- Improved automation efficiency
- Tracker-friendly polling strategies

---

### Built for qui

Harbrr is designed to work alongside qui as part of a modern automation ecosystem.

By centralizing tracker access and search intelligence, Harbrr can provide a common foundation that multiple services can leverage without independently hammering the same trackers.

---

### Cross-Seed Aware

Cross-seeding has unique requirements that traditional indexer managers often overlook.

Harbrr is being designed with cross-seed workflows in mind, including:

- Smarter release matching
- Search reuse and aggregation
- Reduced duplicate tracker activity
- Optional freeleech-aware matching logic
- Optional freeleech bypass logic for cross-seed scenarios

---

### Cardigann Compatibility

Harbrr is built around Cardigann-compatible indexer definitions.

The project aims to leverage the extensive tracker definition ecosystem established by Cardigann, Jackett, and Prowlarr while modernizing the execution engine and overall architecture.

This allows users to benefit from a mature tracker ecosystem without requiring an entirely new definition format.

---

### Full Torznab Compatibility

Harbrr works with:

- Sonarr
- Radarr
- Lidarr
- Readarr
- Mylar
- Whisparr
- autobrr
- qui
- cross-seed
- Any Torznab-compatible application

Existing workflows continue to work while benefiting from Harbrr's centralized intelligence and optimization layer.

---

### Modern Go Architecture

Harbrr is written entirely in Go.

Benefits include:

- Lightweight deployment
- Fast startup times
- Low memory footprint
- Single binary distribution
- Docker-first deployments
- Excellent cross-platform support

---

## Philosophy

Private trackers should be treated as a shared resource.

Many automation stacks unintentionally generate excessive duplicate traffic through repeated RSS polling, repeated searches, and disconnected application behavior.

Harbrr exists to solve that problem.

Rather than every application independently talking to every tracker, Harbrr provides a centralized intelligence layer that can aggregate, cache, optimize, and distribute tracker data throughout your automation ecosystem.

The result is a cleaner architecture, lower tracker load, and a better experience for both users and tracker operators.
